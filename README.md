# Javascript-ES-Diff
From ES6 to ES2022: features added and differences with examples. On this project I'm going through the simplest examples found on the books from 
Dr. Axel Rauschmayer (https://exploringjs.com/). I'm adding examples from different resources as well and sometimes changing the original examples to work with Porsche cars for my own better understanding.
